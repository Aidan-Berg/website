Either way, you are witnessing the ultimate achievement of an amatuer HTML coder, and the peak of technology prior to video streaming: a blog. While they are somewhat outdated, the google search engine still caters to them, and I need a place to cultivate my portfolio a little more cleanly, since the previous strategy of hoping my ancient laptop’s would survive forever is failing quite badly.\nEither way, in the next few weeks I intend to do a lengthy writeup abouta dataset I will pull – I like to talk a lot about my ggplot skills, but since I feel a smidge unethical showing off my charts from work, I will instead write-up my own projcet and see if I can’t make some fun charts to demonstrate that I can, in fact, use ggplot"
